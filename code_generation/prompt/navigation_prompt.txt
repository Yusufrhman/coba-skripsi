Based on the provided Page Transition Graph (PTG), please create a routing configuration file named App.svelte for a svelte application using @mateothegreat/svelte5-router.
Here's the PTG:
{PTG}
Each page node ({page_list}) should correspond to a Svelte component file located in the ./pages folder, with the file name matching the node id with CamelCase and ending with Page.svelte. For example, if the node id is home, the component should be ./pages/HomePage.svelte.
In the App.svelte file, you should import each page like this:
import Home from './pages/HomePage.svelte';
Then, configure the routes object where the key is the node id (as a string) and the value is the imported Svelte component. Pass the routes object to the <Router> component from @mateothegreat/svelte5-router.
example: 
import {{ Router }} from "@mateothegreat/svelte5-router";
const routes: RouteConfig[] = [
  {{
    // Notice that we don't need to specify the path.
    // The router will use this route as the default route when "/" is visited. use the Root node id
    component: Home
  }},
  {{
    path: "/about_us",
    component: AboutUs
  }}
];
Passing the routes to the <Router /> component:

<Router {{routes}} />
