Based on the provided Page Transition Graph (PTG), please create a main App.svelte file for a {UItype} application. The file should do the following:

1. Import necessary packages including svelte-spa-router and your component files (Home.svelte etc.).
2. Set up the router configuration with routes mapping to your page components.
3. Create the main App component that serves as the root component of the svelte application.
4. Include the Router component to handle navigation between pages.
5. Set basic styling and layout structure.
6. Set the default route to your home page component (Home).

Use the following structure as a guide:

```svelte
<script>
  import router from 'svelte-spa-router'
  import Home from './routes/Home.svelte'
  import Example1 from './routes/Example1.svelte'
  import Example2 from './routes/Example2.svelte'

  const routes = {{
    '/': Home,
    '/home': Home,
    '/example1': Example1,
    '/example2': Example2,
  }}
</script>

<main>
  <h1>Your App Name</h1>
  <Router {{routes}} />
</main>

<style>
  main {{
    padding: 1rem;
    max-width: 1200px;
    margin: 0 auto;
  }}

  h1 {{
    text-align: center;
    margin-bottom: 2rem;
    color: #333;
  }}
</style>
```

Replace 'Your App Name' with an appropriate name for the application. The Home component should correspond to the initial page node in the PTG, and the component files should be located in a routes subdirectory (e.g., 'src/routes/').

Here's the PTG:
{PTG}

Your response should only contain the App.svelte code, without any additional prompt information, and do not use code block markup. Ensure that the default route set in the routes configuration corresponds to the initial page in the PTG.
