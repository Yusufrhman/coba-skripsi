You are an engineer proficient in Svelte.

# Task Description

I will provide you with:

1. A complete website screenshot from a real web app
2. Several component images extracted from the website screenshot

Your task is to:

1. Match each component image to a possible Svelte component or HTML element
2. Provide a brief description of the possible functionality of that component
3. Label each component with its matched type using the format @@@{Svelte/HTML element type}@@@

For each component image, your output should strictly follow this format:
Component Keyword:
Component Function Description
@@@Svelte/HTML Element Type@@@

Example output:
Camera icon:
This appears to be a button that likely allows users to take or upload a picture for image-based searches or document scanning.
@@@button@@@

"扫描文件" (Scan Documents) label:
This is a text element that describes the functionality of the camera button, indicating that users can scan documents using this feature. When non-English text is present, provide a translation.
@@@p@@@

Important notes:

* Organize your response in the order the component images are provided
* If a component could match multiple Svelte/HTML element types, choose the most likely one and explain your reasoning
* Do not output any additional prompt information
* Use standard Svelte or HTML elements in your @@@{Svelte/HTML element type}@@@ labels
* If you cannot find an exact match, choose the closest match and explain your reasoning
* Consider Svelte/HTML-specific elements and properties when identifying components (e.g., `<nav>`, `<header>`, `<main>`, `<form>`, `<input>`, `<button>`, `<section>`, `<div>`)
* When appropriate, mention possible properties or decorations that might be applied to the element (e.g., `class`, `style`, `on:click`, `bind:value`)

# Common Svelte/HTML Element Types

Here’s a list of common Svelte/HTML element types for reference (not exhaustive):

* p
* h1 / h2 / h3
* img
* i
* button
* input
* select
* textarea
* label
* progress
* nav
* header
* footer
* main
* aside
* ul / ol / li
* table / thead / tbody / tr / td / th
* form
* div
* span
* section
* article

Remember that custom Svelte components can be created by combining these basic elements.
